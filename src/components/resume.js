          "I am a proud graduate of a historic university, originally founded to educate students of African-American descent and one of the greatest HBCU's, Texas Southern University. I graduated with both B.S., 2017, and M.S., 2020, in Computer Science. I have had the pleasure of working for both Verizon and Microsoft solving tough problems dealing with client side image processing, Babylon.js and webGL, creating NPM libraries, and full stack web applications. I co-founded and was lead engineer of a small education technology start-up where we attacked the problem of class attendance in higher education. Taking a bottom up approach giving instructors flexibility, more time to teach, and an easier way to monitor macro and micro attendance trends in their classrooms. Empowering the next generations is very important to me, that is why I have taught over 200 students, from grade school to university level, the fundamentals of Computer Science and coding. I love everything tech and want to bring as much of that world to underserved communities like the ones I was raised in. With 10+ years enlisted in with the United States Army National Guard I also bring a capacity to accomplish any mission assigned to me, work independently or within a group, and give purpose, direction, and motivation to others thanks to the skills I acquired serving.",

          'I\'m currently working on my M.S. Computer Science at Texas Southern University where he also was awarded his B.S. Computer Science. During my time at TSU, I was a Graduate Research Assistant, Lead System Engineer, Software Developer, and Team Leader for the Center for Research on Complex Networks Education Outreach Software Development section. Under the guidance of a mentor, Dr. Oscar Criner, I led a team of undergraduate and graduate developers in the development of an attendance management system that was adopted by professors University-wide. My passion for software development, technology, and teaching led to me being the first student from TSU to acquire the Lead position with Google Developer Groups - Houston and co-founding the largest student-run Computer Science organization as an undergraduate, the Mobile Application Development Group. My presentation, "Dynamic Data Analytics for Higher Education", won first place Oral Presenter in Computer Sciences & Information Management at the 2017 Emerging Researchers National Conference in STEM for my research on the relationship between class attendance and successful matriculation through STEM degrees in higher education and the creation of an Attendance Management System to help track and manage attendance at my University.',
